\title{
  Conduct the standard normal homogeneity test
}

\description{
  The standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT) tries to detect a breakpoint
  concerning the mean value of a time series, usually in combination with
  a homogeneous reference series. If so, the goal is to detect artifical
  instationarities introduced by e.g. station relocations or sensor
  drifts. 
}

\usage{
applySnht(y, x, method, omit = 0)
}

\arguments{
  \item{y}{numeric vector. The candidate series to be tested.}
  \item{x}{numeric vector. The reference series (often this series is a
    composite of nearby observation sites, e.g. from weather stations).}
  \item{method}{string. Must be either 'ratio' or 'diff' to specify
    whether to take ratios or differences between the candidate and
    reference series.}
  \item{omit}{integer. Number of leading and trailing observations to omit
    when estimating the most probable time point of change.}
}

\details{
  If \code{x} is missing, the test is conducted on the candidate series
  \code{y} only. Since the SNHT is known to be overly sensitive to detect
  breakpoints at the beginning and end of the series, the argument
  \code{omit} can be used to exclude the first and last few time steps
  while extracting the maximum of the test statistic.
}

\value{
  List with entries:
  \item{i}{integer. The index of the most probable breakpoint, i.e. the
    last time step before the break occures.}
  \item{test}{logical vector. Significance of the most probable breakpoint
    \code{i} with respect to the levels 0.1, 0.08, 0.06, 0.05, 0.025, and
    0.01. The critical values are taken from Khaliq and Ouarda (2007).}
  \item{tv}{numeric vector. The test statistic.}
  \item{q}{numeric vector. The q series according to \code{method}; if
    \code{x} is missing, \code{q} equals \code{y} with mean zero and standard
    deviation one.}
